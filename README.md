# Classic Dark GUI; Languages
Here, you can add languages to the Classic Dark GUI.

# How to add a custom language:

If you want to add your language to the resource pack, this is how you can do it:
1. Download .zip
2. Add .lang file (if you are making language for 1.7-1.12) or .json file (if you are making language for 1.13).
  Remember that those files have a different structure!
3. Find the correct texts that need to be edited and put in front of every translation Â§f (which makes the text white)
4. Upload it
 # These are the lines that should be edited: 
 
  1. container.[text] everything there except:
      container.enchant.lapis.one, 
      container.enchant.lapis.many, 
      container.enchant.level.one, 
      container.enchant.level.many, 
      container.enchant.level.requirement, 
      container.enchant.clue
  2. itemGroup.[text] everything there
  
  3. key.advancements
